# Identifier
Something you should know before we go into coding. It is very important that as a programmer you should know

What is an identifier? Nothing just can be named, some letters or special characters, There can be no specific character other than underscores.

SO Identifier is a name having a few letters, numbers and special characters _(Underscore).

When an identifier is written, keep in mind that it does not start with any numeric value. it is used to identify a variabe, Function, Symbolic constant, Class etc...


if you never know what is the name of variable. then understand that a single word is Variable .any word, for example Ethan. so here Ethan will become Variable


(FOR EX:- I took Ethan2 ,so here! Our number is later. It would not be valid if it was first


foo, bar, Sigma, character_name) here these are all valid identifiers

Python is case sensitive programming language.

where D is not equal to d

      t is not equal to T

      Ethan is not equal to ethan

      ethan is not equal to ETHAN

I am saying again a single word is Variable .any word, for example Ethan..
